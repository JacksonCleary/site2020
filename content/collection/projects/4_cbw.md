## coolblueweb

I had the opportunity to work at <a href="https://coolblueweb.com" title="coolblueweb" target="_blank">coolblueweb</a> for about 3 1/2 years.

In that time I built and maintained many websites, webapps, plugins, and tools across PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

During that time we wanted to revamp our corporate site. I built a robust AJAX and SEO friendly frontend and an extensive backend built by modular WordPress PHP plugins.
