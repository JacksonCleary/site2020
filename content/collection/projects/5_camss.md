## CAMSS

This was a project fully developed by me. We initially had designs to run with, and after the initial Phase 1 of our project I took over designing / developing everything.

<a href="https://camss.com" title="CAMSS" target="_blank">What you see on CAMSS.com</a> is a complex backend of WooCommerce, Advanced Custom Fields, the agility of flexbox, and many performance saving frontend techniques to make a ton of WP content manageable and fast.

Many shelters on the site come with a configurator for customization, and I had a lot of fun making both the frontend and backend of these complex pages.
