## StickerGuy!

While working at <a href="https://coolblueweb.com" title="coolblueweb" target="_blank">coolblueweb</a> I was one of the "configurator" guys and had the opportunity to build one for <a href="https://stickerguy.com" title="StickerGuy!" target="_blank">StickerGuy!</a>

It uses a combo of SVG for ineraction and HTML5 Canvas for rendering stickers at the right dimensions / Pixels Per Inch (PPI).

The site also needed custom shipping and pricing rules, which I was able to modularize through a couple of plugin extensions.
