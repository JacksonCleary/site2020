## 4culture

Ever since moving to Seattle I wanted to contribute to the city in some way. Working with <a href="https://4culture.org" title="4culture" target="_blank">4culture</a> on their site revamp allowed me to give back and contribute to local artistic funding and exhibitions. 

During this project I worked as a technical lead to manage and program alongside a team dedicated to making exactly what 4culture needed.
